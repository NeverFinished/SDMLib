<p>Scenario <a href='../test/org/sdmlib/kanban/ProjectBoard.java' type='text/x-java'>ScenarioInfrastructure</a></p>
<pre>This scenario tests the scenario infrastructure. </pre>
<pre>At first creating the html file just with text should work. </pre>
<pre>Next we need to create some class model. This will be done in a parallel activity.</pre>
<pre>With the class model we create an object model and try to dump it here.</pre>
<pre>Well, dumping the class model would be great, either.</pre>
<pre>need to restructure design: logentries shall be direct kids of kanbanentries. 
(has been below phase entries before.)
phase entries will be used for planning, in future</pre>
<embed type="image/svg+xml" src='ScenarioClasses.001.svg'><pre> Editing the log entries works now fine as part of the add method. </pre>
<pre>Seems that we have solved the problem with the sorting of log entries after loading. </pre>
