<p>Storyboard <a href='../test/org/sdmlib/kanban/ProjectBoard.java' type='text/x-java'>StoryboardInfrastructure</a></p>
<p>This storyboard tests the storyboard infrastructure. </p>
<p>At first creating the html file just with text should work. </p>
<p>Next we need to create some class model. This will be done in a parallel activity.</p>
<p>With the class model we create an object model and try to dump it here.</p>
<p>Well, dumping the class model would be great, either.</p>
<p>need to restructure design: logentries shall be direct kids of kanbanentries. 
(has been below phase entries before.)
phase entries will be used for planning, in future</p>
<embed type="image/svg+xml" src='StoryboardClasses.001.svg'><p> Editing the log entries works now fine as part of the add method. </p>
<p>Seems that we have solved the problem with the sorting of log entries after loading. </p>
