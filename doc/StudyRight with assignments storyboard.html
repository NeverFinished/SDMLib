<pre>4. Karli does the third assignment on Integrals, earns 
another 8 points and thus Karli has now 19 points and a motivation of 195.</pre>

for the 17 math credits, Karli hands the points in and earns the credits 
and has his assignmnet points reset to 0. 
(General rule: if the points earned by the assignments are higher or equal than 
the credit points, the credit points will be awarded to the student.)</pre>
