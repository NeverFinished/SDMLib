<p>2. Karli does assignment a1 on Matrix Multiplication and earns 5 points <br>
(general rule: the student earns always full points for doing an assignment). <br>
Karli's motivation is reduced by 5 points to now 209.
</p>
<pre>            karli.setAssignmentPoints(karli.getAssignmentPoints() + matrixMult.getPoints());
      karli.withDone(matrixMult);

<p>3. Karli does assignment a2 on Series and earns another 6 points. <br>
Thus Karli has 11 points now. Motivation is reduced to 203.

<p>4. Karli does the third assignment on Integrals, earns <br>
another 8 points and thus Karli has now 19 points and a motivation of 195.

<pre>            karli.setAssignmentPoints(karli.getAssignmentPoints() + a3.getPoints());

<p>5. Since 19 points are more than the 17 points required 
for the 17 math credits, Karli hands the points in and earns the credits 
and has his assignmnet points reset to 0. <br>
(General rule: if the points earned by the assignments are higher or equal than 
the credit points, the credit points will be awarded to the student.)</p>

<p>6. (end situation/post-condition) Karli has completed the math topic and moves to sports.</p>
<p>Check: Karli's credits:  17 actual 17</p>
<p>Check: Karli's assignment points:  0 actual 0</p>
<p>Check: Number of students:  1 actual 1</p>
