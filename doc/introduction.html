<p>Welcome to SDMLib</p>

<p>SDMLib is a light weight modeling library. SDMLib intentionally comes without any tool or editor. </p>

<p>The idea is that you <em>code</em> your model: </p>

<pre><code>

ClassModel model = new ClassModel();

Clazz uni = model.createClazz("University");

Clazz stud = model.createClazz("Student").withAttribute("name", DataType.STRING);

uni.withAssoc(stud, "students", Card.MANY, "university", Card.ONE);

model.generate();

</code></pre>

<p>By running model.generate() SDMLib will generate source code from your class model. 
If you extend your model later on and regenerate, the code generation will identify 
already existing classes and fields and attributes and leave them untouched. Only new 
elements will be inserted, carefully. </p>

<p>In addition to class models, SDMLib will also support object diagrams, storyboards and model transformations. </p>

<p>Start with <a href="StudyRight%20with%20assignments%20class%20generation.html">StudyRight with assignments class generation</a>
and than look at <a href="StudyRight%20with%20assignments%20storyboard.html">StudyRight with assignments storyboard</a></p>
<p>For advanced model navigation and model transformations have a look at 
   <a href="StudyRightObjectModelNavigationAndQueries.html">StudyRightObjectModelNavigationAndQueries</a></p>

<p>SDMLib comes with [MIT licence]</p>

<p>Have fun </p>
